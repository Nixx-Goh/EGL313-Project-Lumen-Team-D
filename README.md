# üîç Project Introduction
Our project is a **smart mirror maze** that uses **Raspberry Pi** and other elements such as **Laser, Light Sensors, PCA9685 Servo Driver, Servo Motors and MDP218 MIDI Pad** to create a fun and interactive experience. The goal is to make a mirror maze where players have to navigate through the maze by using a laser that will create a laser path and use the MIDI PAD to rotate the servo motor that has a mirror attached  to get the angle for the laser path to bounce off from one end of the maze to the center of the maze where the light sensor will be placed.

There will be 4 stages, with the 1st stage being the easiest and 4th to be the most challenging


# üõ†Ô∏è What are we using and why

 The **Raspberry Pi** acts as the master, which then connects and controls the other elements:

 * **Laser:** To create a laser path for players to navigate through the maze

 * **Light Sensors:** To detect
