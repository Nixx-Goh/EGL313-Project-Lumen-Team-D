In this project, we are building an interactive mirror maze that challenges players to navigate through a mirror maze using a MPD218 MIDI pad controller to get to the end. With Raspberry Pi acting as the master, coordinating the various components to create a dynamic and responsive environment.

We are integrating the following key components:

1. **Servo Motor (via PCA9685)** to controlt the rotation of mirrors
2. **Lasers** to
